//javascript is dynamically language means like in c++ we have to define data types before any giving value like int a = 10 but in JAVASCRIPT (we can just write a = 10 it automatically run we not have to define data type)

Fullname = "Mehta aum";
age = 20;
price = 20.99;
x = null; //null has no value (empty)
y = undefined; //declared but not assign any value (undefined) //we can write like these also y; // to not assign any value 
check = false; //boolean
console.log(check);
